In its first year, institutions and individuals throughout Europe have supported public sector bodies in releasing data and numerous start-ups, developers and SMEs in reusing this data for economic benefit. However, we are still at the beginning of the open data movement, and there is still more that can be done to make open data simpler to use and to make it available to a wider audience. The core goal of the DaPaaS project is to provide a Data- and Platform-as-a-Service environment, where 3rd parties (such as governmental organisations, SMEs, developers and larger companies) can publish and host both data sets and data-intensive applications, which can then be accessed by end-user applications in a cross-platform manner. You can find out more about DaPaaS on the detailed about page. Essentially, DaPaaS aims to make publishing, consumption, and reuse of open data, as well as deploying open data applications, easier and cheaper for SMEs and small public bodies which otherwise may not have sufficient technical expertise, infrastructure and resources required to do so.","slug":"dapaas-home","tag_ids":["dapaas","page"],"format":"page","created_at":"2013-12-18T13:19:57+00:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/dapaas-consortium.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/dapaas-consortium","title":"DaPaaS Consortium","details":{"description":"The DaPaaS consortium brings together six partners from five different countries, experts specialising in the fields of research, semantic technology, open and linked data, mobile application development and technical communications.

European Data Forum 2014 Athens, Greece [March 19-20, 2014] >The EDF is the annual meeting-point for data practitioners from industry, research, policy makers, the wider public-sector and community initiatives, to discuss the opportunities and challenges of the emerging Data Economy in Europe. Participating within EDF 2014 will be global experts in a wide range of fields, including: research, semantic technology, open and linked data, mobile application development and technical communications. By bringing together all stakeholders and practitioners involved in the data industry, this will allow for the fostering of ideas, new innovations and problem-solving associated challenges, leading to a strengthened data economy within Europe and increasing its visibility worldwide. FutureEverything Festival 2014 Manchester, UK [March 27 - April 1, 2014] >FutureEverything brings together international delegates from design, urbanism art, business and academia to discover, share and experience new ideas about the future. Pioneering the idea of a \u2018festival as laboratory\u2019, it combines innovative art and performance with new technology, insightful discussion and playful social experimentation. The 2014 theme is \u2018Tools for Unknown Futures\u2019,and will explore how we can collaborate on new tools, devices and systems to transform many spheres of life, from the arts to democracy. OKFestival Berlin, Germany [July 15-18, 2014] >The Open Knowledge Festival is a global, inclusive and participatory event. It is organised by the Open Knowledge Foundation Central and owned by the open knowledge community in the broadest sense. The 2014 festival will focus on the themes of open data and open knowledge.","slug":"dapaas-events","tag_ids":["dapaas","page"],"format":"page","created_at":"2013-12-18T11:03:04+00:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/dapaas-work-packages.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/dapaas-work-packages","title":"DaPaaS work packages ","details":{"description":"The research is structured into seven work packages: Work package 1 (DaaS for open data) will analyse the current data-as-a-service offerings and seeks to understand best practice and draw up technical recommendations for the project. Led by Ontotext , it will aggregate the requirements for the service and provide the design and architecture for the DaaS software infrastructure, as well as provide actual software prototypes. Work package 2 (PaaS for open data applications) will provide an analysis, best practice and technical recommendations based on current platform-as-a-service offerings. Led by SINTEF , it will aggregate the requirements for the service and provide the design and architecture for the DaaS software infrastructure, as well as provide actual software prototypes, integrating into the prototype provided in WP1, thus providing an integrated DaPaaS platform. Work package 3 (Cross-platform open data consumption) is being led by SIRMA mobile , and will provide both the framework that facilitates the creation of mobile APIs for data access; the modular user-interface for easily building web apps, and the multi-platform modules for easily building native apps. Work package 4 (DaPaaS methodology) focuses on establishing a clear and simple methodology of data publishing, ensuring that DaPaaS delivers a tool which will lower the complexity of open data publishing for non-experts. Swirrl will lead on the work in WP4 which will select, integrate and where necessary, develop the tools to support this simple methodology, applying it to a selection of use cases as identified in WP5. Work package 5 (Use cases) will define in detail the real-life use cases to be used in DaPaaS. Saltlux led, the use cases defined will generate the detailed technical requirements as outlined previously in WP1-4, ensuring that DaPaaS delivers infrastructure, suitable for all a wide-range of domains that could create business opportunities and efficiencies. WP5 will also define methods for the validation of the infrastructure. Work package 6 (Dissemination) will be led by the ODI and will include development and execution of the impact strategy for DaPaaS. This strategy will ensure that the project engages directly with relevant communities, as well as acting on their feedback to increase the relevance, effectiveness, and adoption of the final product. WP6 includes the creation of the project website, presence on other relevant community channels, and ensuring that DaPaaS continues to have an impact after it has been completed. Work package 7 (Report) focuses on the management and monitoring of the DaPaaS project, including both operational and financial strands. It ensures that all project reports are prepared and delivered, and that all quality aspects of the project are fully addressed. SINTEF, as as project co-ordinators, will lead on WP7.","slug":"dapaas-work-packages","tag_ids":["dapaas","page"],"format":"page","created_at":"2013-12-11T16:04:25+00:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/dapaas-media-assets.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/dapaas-media-assets","title":"DaPaaS media assets ","details":{"description":"The news section of our website contacts all press releases and blog posts.
