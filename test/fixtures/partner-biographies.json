He then decides that it is a tickling sort of day and so goes around town tickling people - a teacher, a policeman, a greengrocer, a child, a station guard, a pilot, a doctor, a butcher and a postman. The book ends with a warning that Mr. Tickle could be lurking around your doorway, waiting to tickle you or your children.","role":"Tickler","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Tickle","organisation":{"name":"Tickle Inc","slug":"tickle-inc"},"web_url":"/uploads/assets/e9/14/52e914a160aa27ffb7000003/Mr._Tickle.jpg","square":"/uploads/assets/e9/14/52e914a160aa27ffb7000003/square_Mr._Tickle.jpg"}}]}
