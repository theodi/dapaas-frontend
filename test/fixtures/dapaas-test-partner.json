As an independent, non-profit, non-partisan company, the ODI provides a catalyst for the evolution of an open data culture, creating economic, environmental and social value. The ODI works with government, the commercial, public, and not-for-profit sectors, in the UK and worldwide to unlock the supply of open data and build understanding of the benefits of doing so. </p>\n\n<p>Through an incubation programme for open data startups and a network of over 50 members, the ODI is stimulating the demand for open data in areas such as transparency and open innovation. By conducting research and contributing to policy, the ODI is developing and disseminating open data best practices, exemplified by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org\">Open Data Certificates</a> service, which provides a seal of approval for published data sets. </p>\n\n<p>Through a public training programme, the convening of world class experts from industry and academic, and the ongoing Open Data Challenge series, the ODI is building capability across a range of sectors and communities. Contributions from the ODI to wider initiatives, such as the Smart London board (exploring smart city solutions for London), ensure that open data delivers the greatest possible economic, environmental and social value.</p>\n","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Open Data Institute (ODI)","url":"http://theodi.org","telephone":123456,"twitter":"UKODI","linkedin":"http://linkedin.com/example","email":"info@theodi.org","joined_at":null,"tagline":"","involvement":"","want_to_meet":"","case_study":"","logo":{"web_url":"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/a9/b3/52a9b3dcd0d4624a8c000006/outline-solid-W-170px.png","versions":{"square":"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/a9/b3/52a9b3dcd0d4624a8c000006/square_outline-solid-W-170px.png"},"content_type":"image/png","title":null,"source":null,"description":null,"creator":null,"attribution":null,"subject":null,"license":null,"spatial":{"lng":null,"lat":null}}},"tags":[{"title":"DaPaaS","id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/roles/dapaas.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"DaPaaS","short_description":null,"type":"role"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?role=dapaas","web_url":"theodi.org/browse/dapaas","slug":"dapaas"},"parent":null},{"title":"Partner","id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/organizations/partner.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Partner","short_description":null,"type":"organization"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?organization=partner","web_url":"theodi.org/browse/partner","slug":"partner"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-open-data-institute.json","web_url":"theodi.org/odi-open-data-institute","slug":"odi-open-data-institute","title":"Open Data Institute (ODI)","format":"organization","tag_ids":["dapaas","partner"],"updated_at":"2013-12-12T13:57:41+00:00","created_at":"2013-12-12T12:48:58+00:00"}
